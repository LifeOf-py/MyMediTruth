This result suggests that the drug might be useful for a small number of patients who aren’t helped by other treatments.

It would have been very helpful to estimate what proportion of migraine sufferers fall into the subpopulation that might stand to benefit.

There was no way to know if anyone was actually choosing to use marijuana instead of opioids.

Health professionals—from doctors to policy experts—are exploring strategies for controlling the opioid crisis gripping the U.S. Advocates for legalizing marijuana for medical or recreational purposes have suggested that increased access to marijuana could curb opioid use. The two studies published in JAMA Internal Medicine discussed in this CNN article found that state legalization of medical marijuana was associated with a decrease in opioid prescriptions.
But before it presented the data, the article led readers to believe the study findings “suggest that there is merit” in “using medical marijuana to help Americans struggling with opioid addiction,”—which is beyond what the studies could possibly show.
The article took another misstep when it stated that the researchers analyzed opioid prescriptions to “evaluate whether medical marijuana could function as an effective and safe alternative to opioids.” The data the researchers looked at could not answer that question. These were not clinical trials comparing pain relief from marijuana with pain relief from opioids in patients who would typically be prescribed opioids. They were analyses of data on opioid prescriptions in Medicaid and Medicare databases.
The researchers detail the limitations of their studies, as does a commentary published along with them. But only one limitation made it into the article: the caveat that the results may not be generalizable to the entire U.S. population because they only used data on patients enrolled in Medicare and Medicare Part D.

This story excitedly describes the “remarkable” finding that by deleting an enzyme called BACE1 in a mouse model, researchers were able to stop the amyloid plaques found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s from developing. The enthusiasm is tempered later in the story, when it is noted that previous advances in treating Alzheimer’s in mice have not translated into success in treating Alzheimer’s in people.
The story tells readers there are BACE1 inhibitors in clinical trials in humans, and quotes the study’s lead researcher as saying these drugs could provide hope for Alzheimer’s patients, “if” they can be used long term and don’t have side effects. But that’s a very big “if.” Missing from the story is this background: a number of BACE1 inhibitors have been studied in human clinical trials and were not found to be effective. In fact, just before this story was published, Merck announced it was halting a BACE1 trial after an interim analysis showed it was unlikely that a positive benefit/risk ratio could be established.

This highly readable first-person story by a writer who suffers from migraine headaches describes new antibody treatments that are under FDA review. The story effectively conveys the risks of trying monoclonal antibodies, describes how they work, and explains hurdles to getting them. Especially effective is a description of the litany of treatment approaches the writer has tried over the years, to little avail, and her quest to participate in clinical trials in pursuit of the “tantalizing reward of a migraine-free life.”
The story is also open about costs and potential harms from the therapies. However, the story could have used more discussion of the evidence for these new therapies–what kind of trials have been conducted, and what are their limitations?

The story may also confuse readers in how it refers to “watchful waiting.” The term is most often used to describe a treatment known as active surveillance for men with slow-growing cancers. But this story applies the term to a smaller group of men with high-risk cancers who are hoping to delay recurrence and spread of the cancer.

This story summarizes the results of two studies involving drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer. The main takeaway from the story is that in certain men with high-risk cancers who’ve already had their prostates removed, the drugs extended the amount of time before these men’s cancer spread beyond the prostate. The story helpfully quantifies the amount of time the drugs bought these men in absolute terms.
But the story missed some important context. For example, the story is totally silent on the issue of adverse effects and how many patients suffered them. And it doesn’t caution that the outcome reported in the study — “metastasis-free survival” — may not translate to a corresponding increase in patients’ overall length of life.
Disease-mongering was also a concern. The story features statistics about the huge numbers of prostate cancers diagnosed each year, but it doesn’t acknowledge that most of these cancers will never progress to cause problems for the patient. Moreover, it erroneously suggests that prostate removal is the “typical” approach to the treatment of early prostate cancer, when no treatment at all is the approach favored by about half of all men who receive such a diagnosis.

But more needed to be said about the potential harms of the treatments–which carry risks–as well as their general availability and cost.

Stemming disability and deaths from opioid use disorder is a major public health challenge, and medication has become the treatment of choice to help people with addiction. The study reported in this CNN story compares two available drugs—buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone) and naltrexone (Vivitrol)—that can blunt or block cravings and reduce illicit opioid use.
The clinical study found that people with opioid use disorder were far more likely to begin taking one (Suboxone) than the other (Vivitrol), principally because Vivitrol requires patients to have first gone through detoxification. That’s an important difference, the article notes, as effectiveness is more likely if a physician can choose a drug that fits her patient’s circumstances. The story does a nice job of making this point, although it gives less attention to another sobering pattern unearthed by the study: Among the subjects who started the drugs, fewer than half were still taking them six months later. Also, more needed to be said about the potential harms of the medications–both carry risks–as well as their general availability and cost.

The news story reports on the findings of a recent study published in JAMA, which evaluated the effectiveness of four painkillers in addressing acute arm or leg pain in emergency room patients. One of the painkillers was a combination of the over-the-counter medications acetaminophen and ibuprofen; the other three painkillers were combinations of acetaminophen and an opioid (oxycodone, hydrocodone or codeine). The study found that — within the two-hour window being evaluated — there was no statistical significant difference in the effectiveness of the four drugs, indicating that acetaminophen/ibuprofen is a viable alternative to opioids for addressing acute pain.

Given the long clinical trial road ahead, despite MDMA’s “breakthrough” status designation, much could change.

Post-traumatic stress disorder is difficult to treat.  Over the course of the past decade, evidence has been accumulating that the compound 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), better known as ecstasy, may be more effective than current drugs such as Zoloft and Paxil.
This story, jump-started by a recent decision by the Food and Drug Administration to classify MDMA as a “breakthrough drug,” which allows it to be evaluated and possibly approved more quickly, offers the reader a well-written account of the evolution of MDMA from a bad actor to a potentially efficacious one.
An important element of the narrative is the dominant role of a nonprofit organization, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, which is dedicated to ending government bans on psychedelic substances and marijuana and has funded virtually all of the extant research on MDMA’s impact on PTSD sufferers. While the story is well-sourced, the text fails to explore this conflict of interest. It also may land too heavily on the side of “probable” rather than “possible.”

The overall issue for women who want to treat vaginal dryness is that the bar is set very low for FDA approval of devices (in contrast to studies needed to approved medicines), and although the article touts the MLTL as having undergone “long term studies,” the literature suggests that the longest follow up in studies of it and its shelf mates is closer to 12 weeks.

story_reviews_00249,"NBC’s single source report on device for treating cluster headaches lacks balance

Relying on just one source, the story doesn’t tackle any of the weaknesses of the research, including its failure to reach its goal. Only when a smaller sub-group of volunteers was analyzed did the device show a statistical improvement in symptoms.

A critique of the study limitations, cost and a meaningful description of benefits are all markedly absent in this NBC.com story on the FDA approval of a hand-held electronic device to treat people with cluster headaches, a rare form of extremely painful and debilitating headaches. The gammaCore device is designed to stimulate the vagus nerve through the skin of the neck.
The article draws substantially from a news release issued by the device’s maker, including four quotes.  The only physician-researcher quotes come from the person who tested the device and co-authored a study published about the test results in 2016. We wish the story would have included some indication of the device’s cost since it’s set to hit the U.S. market later this year.
The article aptly notes that its unclear how the vagus nerve stimulator works, but it neglects to explain that the study cited found no significant differences in full or short-term pain relief between 62 people using the device, compared to 73 treated with a sham device. Only when a “subset analysis” was performed on those with occasional cluster headaches was there evidence of benefit to about 25 percent of those treated, compared to 15 percent getting the sham treatment.
The NBC.com story could have highlighted these limitations of the study and noted that many people with cluster headaches should not use the device (anyone with an implanted medical device, with high blood pressure, or with heart rhythm disturbances); and that overall the stimulator  — while deemed safe and modestly effective for some — may have limited usefulness.

Relying on just one expert source invites trouble, particularly when the source has multiple ties to the intervention and stands to gain financially from its approval.

This CBS news story describes a possible mechanism by which botox (onabotulinumtoxinA) treatments could be an effective treatment for major depression. It cites a dermatologist who explains the possibility of a feedback loop between the facial muscles that express emotion and the amygdala in the brain. It suggests that botox may offer hope for treating not only depression, but also social anxiety and bipolar disorder.
However, the only evidence this story provides is a single anecdote by an army veteran. The only expert it cites is a dermatologist who stands to gain financially if the treatment receives FDA approval, and who has been a paid consultant for the company manufacturing the drug.
Like Allergan’s news release on a recently completed phase 2 trial of botox for depression (which the CBS story doesn’t mention) the article also omitted any specific description of the benefit, harms, alternative treatments for major depression and how botox might compare with them. The CBS story does, however, provide readers with a cost reference, something the release didn’t do.
It should also be noted that this single anecdote story ended with a quote from that one patient.  Coincidentally, today, at the Association of Health Care Journalists annual conference, this advice was given by a veteran journalist and academic Jacqui Banaszynski: “Be careful if you end a story with a quote because whoever you give the last quote to you give the story to.” Be careful, because this tends to bias the reader’s perception, as this story may have done.",fake,146,97,26,269

Results showed that the five-year survival rate for recipients was not changed much by the age of the donor, however, donors over 80 years of age had kidneys that could not be used–and had to be discarded–almost half the time.
The post is a quick summary, and left out important details: What are the risks of using kidneys from older donors? What are the rules regarding the age of donors in the U.S.? We also found the headline (“Never too old to be a organ donor”) and some of the story framing off the mark by overgeneralizing the findings.",fake,465,438,16,919

Despite some flaws, this study offers reassurance that premature babies who spend their early days with skin-to-skin will fare at least as well as adults as those who were in an incubator. Stories should not extrapolate beyond that.

This story reports on a 20-year follow-up study of low birth weight infants in Colombia who received continuous skin-to-skin contact with a caregiver as part of a practice known as kangaroo mother care (KMC).
Researchers concluded that infants who had been randomized to receive KMC rather than staying in an incubator reaped long-lasting social and behavioral benefits such as lower mortality, lower school absenteeism and fewer behavior problems.
This coverage describes both positive and negative findings of the 20-year outcomes, which were reported in the journal Pediatrics, but it doesn’t include quantified data or tap independent sources.

This story accurately describes the study, but — in our opinion — doesn’t go far enough in placing the work in context. For example, the headline uses strong language: “Pets help people manage the pain of serious mental illness.” However, that headline is based on the self-reporting of 25 patients in the United Kingdom who already own pets and consider them part of their social network.

Financially-minded readers want to make a good investment not predicated on hype, and readers want to take a safe, effective drug.

This story looks at new findings on the benefits of adding a monoclonal antibody drug known as Repatha to statin therapy in people with heart disease.
We liked that the story makes it clear that so far, prescribers and insurers have been underwhelmed by the evidence showing that the drug can reduce heart attacks and deaths better than already-available and far-cheaper statins. We get some behind-the-scenes details on how hard it is to get this drug covered by insurers, and given dollar figures on cost of the drug.
This new study, though, apparently “bodes well”  for changing this reluctance, because researchers saw fewer heart attacks, deaths, and other serious cardiac events in the study group taking Repatha and a statin, compared to the statin-only group. Yet, the story states that the study was too small to determine if these numbers were significant.
And if that’s the case, why is this study newsworthy?

It reports that this “new form” of therapy, one that is parent-child driven rather than therapist-child driven, is a “potential breakthrough” in efforts to moderate the repetitive behaviors, tantrums, outbursts and other core symptoms, and that all of the children whose parents got the training showed significant and measurable improvement at the end of the one-year intervention.
What the article fails to say, however, is that the main outcome measurement — improvement long term at a follow up evaluation after five years — did not show a statistically significant difference between the intervention group and a group whose parents got conventional “parent education.” The intervention group had better results than the control group immediately after the initial treatment period, but both groups had worsened somewhat at the long-term follow-up assessment. Although the intervention group results were still better, this difference could have been due to chance. It’s uncertain, therefore, whether the intervention clearly improves symptom scores more than conventional treatment.
That more cautionary detail should have made its way into the story. We did like that the story mentions this is by no means a cure, and that children will still need plenty of support growing up.

story_reviews_00343,"Are expensive, potent anti-inflammatory drugs a future option for depression? CNN’s story needed more scrutiny of evidence

Also: Neither the story nor the news release talked about the steep cost of this relatively new class of anti-inflammatories.

CNN’s story about the potential future use of a type of anti-inflammatory drug to treat depression is based largely on research described in a news release issued by the University of Cambridge.
The story accurately reports serious interest by the principal investigator of the new research, and others, in tantalizing links between the immune system’s responsive  inflammatory chemicals–cytokines–and mental illness. In this case, the investigators accumulated evidence for the potential value of anti-cytokine therapy by focusing on anti-depressant effects of the drugs reported as side effects in a meta-analysis of 7 substantial clinical studies, mostly involving those with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. The story quotes the principal investigator’s explanation for those links.
But unlike the study and the news release (which we also reviewed), it waits until the last two sentences to point out that the antidepressant effects of anti-cytokine drugs are at best “mild,” and essentially fails to point out that even if the new drugs were eventually proven safe and effective for depression, it’s likely that only a small subset of depressed people–those with chronic inflammation and resistant to current antidepressants–would find benefit over and above what other treatments already offer.
It’s worth noting that the news release did a better job of pointing out the limitations and side effects of any use of anti-cytokines in the future; and of making clear that randomized clinical trials are needed even to get near the point of using the drugs. Neither the news release nor the story, though, talked about the cost of this relatively new class of anti-inflammatories, some of which which are currently heavily advertised, but used to treat only severe cases of autoimmune disorders.",fake,179,26,0,205

lung cancer illustration
Non-small cell lung cancer is a hard disease to treat.  A newer immunotherapy drug developed by Merck & Co and called Keytruda—which activates a patient’s immune system to fight the disease—has been shown in a clinical trial to stop the disease’s progression for a longer period of time than does standard chemotherapy treatment, but only in a select group of patients with certain biomarkers.  A smaller clinical trial that gave patients (without biomarkers) both drug and chemotherapy treatments and also shrank tumors and slowed disease progression is heralded as the first to demonstrate the relative efficacy of that combination.
This Reuters story shares this good news but didn’t explain the specifics: That Keytruda halted cancer progression by only about four months compared to the chemo group. It also didn’t state how much those extra months will impact the patient–financially and in quality of life; adverse events in the trials are glossed over.
Lastly, its “new day” headline and overall optimistic tone may mislead some people into thinking the drug offers lengthy survival (or even a cure) for anyone with this type of often-lethal cancer; instead this reference is to the fact that patients will now get tested for certain genetic biomarkers to see if immunotherapy is the better targeted therapy. How many people with this type of cancer have these biomarkers–and will therefore benefit–isn’t stated.

This misleading notion is reinforced by the headline, “How to heal head injuries? Try a new app.” It’s not available for trying, and it’s not intended to heal head injuries.

Concussions incurred during sporting events in middle and high schools may have substantial health impacts on young athletes. Recognition of those impacts has grown exponentially in the US, generating earnest efforts to find ways to diagnose possible problems during games, before an athlete returns to the fray and runs the risk of making things worse. A number of companies now market baseline testing products, which usually involve a “baseline” neurological exam at the start of the season. Later, if the athlete is injured during a game, a shorter “sideline” exam can be conducted to compare to the original exam.
This AP story reports on a Michigan-based organization that made baseline testing available to schools in order to gather data over the course of a year about the frequency of potential concussions across ages, genders and type of sport.
The story does a nice job of summarizing the results of that study but treats the concept of baseline testing uncritically. Can the brief sideline diagnostic efforts in the midst of a game actually detect a problem in the making?  It depends on who you “ask.” Baseline testing is currently fashionable in medical circles.

The story overall does a fair job of summarizing the main points about the study’s conclusions, and about the ongoing confusion, contradictions, and controversy surrounding best practices for “breast screening intervals.” It could have been clearer at the outset that the key conclusions related to triennial screening should apply solely to women over 50 at average or low risk of breast cancer. It could also have done a better job of bringing in outside commentary and interpretation from those not directly involved in the study, noting the weaknesses of “modeling” systems in general, and offering more detail about the potential physical and psychological harms unnecessary biopsies and treatments.

The story clearly takes the viewpoint that this is the case, and yet we aren’t given enough evidence from the study itself–or other studies alluded to–to make this assessment for ourselves.

story_reviews_00376,"HealthDay story misleads by making osteoporosis study sound like it compared two drugs

Here’s a case where the primary endpoints should have been closely paid attention to when reporting on the findings.

The story reports on research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association studying an experimental drug known as abaloparatide and its ability to prevent a new vertebral fracture in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.
A standout positive for this story is its choice to report the absolute risk, rather than relative risk, of fracture due to low bone density (see Disease Mongering criterion below). Read more on why this matters.
But, there are a few problems concerning the subtleties of the study design. Specifically, the research study was not powered to detect significant differences between abaloparatide and its currently-available competitor, Forteo (teriparatide). Thus, any juxtaposition of quantitative figures comparing the efficacy of the two drugs must be presented with important caveats, which we didn’t see emphasized enough in the news story.
Instead, the story leads with a claim that abaloparatide reduces fracture risk “better” than the competing drug–something the study wasn’t designed to address and which is misleading.
We’d note that a JAMA news release about the study, which we also reviewed, largely sidesteps this issue by avoiding any statements that directly compare the two drugs. But could the release have helped reporters out here by making a clear, unambiguous statement regarding the purpose of the study and its limitations? The researchers include such a statement in the text of the research article itself (see below under the “Evidence” criterion), and in hindsight it seems that the news release would have done well to emphasize this key nuance.
Another way journalists can avoid this problem? Emphasize the findings related to the study’s primary endpoints, and always read the study’s discussion and limitations sections to find important caveats. Accompanying editorials also often have illuminating points to make, too.",real,167,11,1,179

This story leans hard on a single patient’s story, and avoids discussion of what the evidence shows to support this treatment for PSTD.

This story reflects on the journey of a young woman who finds relief in a strategy called eye movement and desensitization and reprocessing therapy (EMDR), which, according to the EMDR Institute, asks a client to reflect on “emotionally disturbing material in brief sequential doses while simultaneously focusing on an external stimulus”; in many cases, that external stimulus is some type of repetitive eye movement. Proponents of the therapy argue that it relieves emotional distress and reduces physiological reactions to traumatic memories.
The story does offer cautionary information from a psychologist who does not employ the strategy, and who questions the superiority of the technique over other established strategies. However, the overwhelming message of this vivid anecdotal account is that EMDR can help.
The story notes that the patient is indifferent to issues of evidence; “what mattered is whether it [EMDR] worked for her.” While that may be the case, urging readers to be similarly indifferent is a problem.

Despite what the researchers may claim, this type of study can’t prove that exercise can “undo the damage of sitting” — all it can do is show associations between these behaviors and risk of death. There are many factors, other than exercise and sedentary behavior, that affect one’s risk of death (e.g. diet, illnesses, socioeconomic factors), and the story didn’t explain that researchers can’t account for all of those factors in a study like this.

The story is problematic on several fronts, and was concerning enough that we used it to examine the hazards of first-person reporting on health interventions in a separate blog post, “Washington Post’s story on platelet-rich plasma injections highlights drawbacks of first-person health reporting.”
In sum, it is a first-person account of one individual’s experience, not an actual report on the efficacy of a new approach to such injuries. Research-wise, it only cites, anecdotally, one tiny pilot study of the procedure and fails to provide any real data on those and other results, including a Cochrane systematic review, which is one of the most authoritative sources of evidence on hand today. It also leans heavily on quotes from the physician treating the writer, and provides no information that would convince readers that his statements are free from conflict.
It’s also important to point out a factual error in the story: Injecting lidocaine into the shoulder or another area known as the subacromia bursa numbs up more than just the rotator cuff. The rotator cuff, itself, is not injected.",fake,77,53,6,136

This story is another example of an experimental stem cell therapy receiving news coverage while the research is still preliminary.

A man with ALS participates in a fundraiser for research in New York City.
This story describes a small Phase 2 safety-focused trial of stem cell injections to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. The trial involving 15 patients tested whether the stem cell injections, previously performed in low doses at Emory University, would be safe in progressively larger doses administered at multiple medical centers. The study was published in the journal Neurology.
There isn’t much news here; the question remains open as to whether stem cells could be a safe and effective therapy for ALS. Nothing from these studies suggest that this treatment may slow or reverse progression of ALS. Given that, the story did a good job outlining the harms and risks from the procedure, and it included quotes from independent experts.

This story urges people to make sure they’re eating enough dietary fiber, with a focus on fiber’s role in promoting healthy weight loss. And, overall, it does a fairly good job — though giving a high-profile to unpublished data from a privately-owned fitness app (MyFitnessPal) is a little unusual.
To draw causal conclusions about a specific food/dietary component, without providing fulsome data is worrisome. Also, we’re unaware of any studies at this point that speak to the veracity of MyFitnessPal dietary record keeping, and the accuracy of its collection is probably worth validating and exploring–or at least noting its limitations.

The story serves up an important reminder that we can’t say something “prevents a heart attack” for research of this nature, where rates of heart attacks weren’t actually measured. Instead, surrogate markers, such as lipid levels, were used.

This is a story about a now year-old study looking at whether a program of semi-personalized mobile phone text messages supporting healthy lifestyle choices led to significant differences in cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure, and BMI in a group of patients with known coronary heart disease, compared to those who did not receive such messages.
The story makes those differences clear in an accessible chart. What is less clear is whether these differences are due to beneficial changes caused by the text messages or other factors. For example, in a subsequent letter to the journal, a researcher notes that the differences in blood pressure between the two groups were due mainly to 7-point increase in the control group, whereas the text message group’s blood pressure stayed about the same over the course of the study. Similarly, the BMI differences between the groups were due partly to an increase in BMI in the control group and weren’t entirely due to reductions in the text message group. The story communicates the study results accurately and doesn’t suggest that the text messages lowered CVD risk factors from baseline. Without a more specific explanation, however, many readers may assume that’s what happened.
Another cautionary note is that the headline goes beyond the findings, suggesting that text messages can possibly “prevent” heart attacks. The study offers no evidence for that link: There was no measurement of heart attack rates between groups. Instead, they measured several surrogate markers associated with heart disease, such as lipid levels and blood pressure.",real,207,155,3,365

This story covers a meta-analysis led by a researcher at the University of Oxford (UK) that examined peer-reviewed studies on the effects of 14 antidepressants on children and adolescents diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Published in the Lancet, the study found that only fluoxetine, marketed in the U.S. under the name Prozac, was shown in trials to be significantly more effective than placebo, though its clinical effectiveness isn’t clear from available data. The study also found “robust evidence” that the drug venlafaxine (Effexor) raises the risk of suicidal behavior.
The fact that Prozac is singled out in the headline as possibly “the only drug that effectively treats depression in kids” may lead readers to think that there is solid evidence of Prozac’s safety and efficacy, which there isn’t.

The story provides an overview of researcher Jim Allison and his role in developing the cancer immunotherapy treatment drug ipilimumab (also referred to as “Ippy”) that is used in treating some melanoma cases.
It is an interesting story, and holds the reader’s attention. However, while the story plays up the significant benefits ipilimumab can provide for some people (drawn heavily from one patient’s heartwarming success story), it also gives readers an unrealistic set of expectations.

The study itself had significant limitations: There were a variety of interventions used at a large number of TIA units in many countries, but no control group or randomization. The TIA units were cherry-picked based on high volume of patients. All of the patients in the study received the best possible care–meaning that there was no comparable group of patients who could serve as a control. That’s good for the patients, but makes it difficult to judge what role the overall care played in limiting stroke risk and producing the “lower-than-expected” outcomes. And that’s perhaps the biggest weakness of the study: Its broad conclusion about typical outcomes versus what the study saw at TIA units. This comparison was made by looking at decade-old numbers on how many TIA patients typically go on to have serious strokes, but those numbers are outdated, since many treatments have evolved since then.

But our review team (which includes a primary care physician who educates other physicians on the clinical management of drug and alcohol problems) thought the story relied on relatively unsubstantiated, unpublished claims of safety and efficacy by a company that makes a buprenorphine implant and very little citation of actual published data or expert attribution of information. To its credit, the article hits most of the sticking points involved in the long history of opioid addiction, highlighting that regulations have promoted liberal prescribing of medications that lead to addiction and also inhibit doctors from prescribing medication to treat addiction. It reviews the lack of well-trained doctors, risks of, and restrictions on, prescription “bupes” and the rising prevalence of heroin addiction well beyond urban settings.

This story reports that in an Australian study of 70 children (average age 9.5 years), those who had experienced a higher number of traumatic events also had higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol in samples of their hair. The researchers are hypothesizing that the cortisol levels might be a marker of future mental health problems in the children, as people with depression and other mental health problems, as well as physical problems like diabetes, sometimes have high levels of cortisol.
Here’s the problem with this story: The study being reported on never actually looked at whether cortisol levels had anything to do with future mental health diagnoses. And in fact, cortisol levels were found not to be correlated with current depressive symptoms in these children. Moreover, the study had such a small sample as to make any conclusions resulting from it highly uncertain.

In this story, the FDA is weighing a request to add folic acid to corn flour in order to possibly prevent neural tube defects during pregnancy. Hispanic women are at higher risk of giving birth to babies with these issues. Corn flour is often consumed more than white or wheat flours in some diets. Folic acid is already added to white and wheat flours. The story does a good job of explaining the logic of adding folic acid to corn flour and what benefits it might yield. A bit more attention to the costs of such a program and the alternatives to it (e.g. vitamin pills) would have been welcome.",real,362,159,17,538

This brief HealthDay story explains the findings of a study by New York researchers comparing two classes of drugs — angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE, inhibitors versus newer angiotensin receptor blockers, or ARBs — used to treat cardiovascular disease.  It reports on a meta-analysis of more than 100 studies comparing either drug with a placebo or with each other and finds that both types of medications are equally effective.  The only difference being that ARBs tend to produce fewer cases of dry cough as a side effect than do ACE inhibitors.
This story is shorter and less nuanced than a competing Washington Post piece, and it relies excessively on a New York University news release. There is more information about the underlying mechanism of these drugs, something probably of less interest to readers, but less about what is new about this study and why it may be important. The story never clarifies what outcomes we’re talking about with this research — blood pressure, heart attacks, deaths? In addition, the emphasis on the finding of better tolerability does not discuss why this may be – there’s no mention of the greater likelihood of cough and angioedema with ACEIs.

Despite a 4-star score, this story lets readers down in some important ways, first by not adequately explaining the small size of the effect and by not addressing some key limitations.

In this story, we hear about a long-term comparison of three kinds of birth in Scotland: planned C-section, unplanned C-section and vaginal delivery. This enormous observational study included more than 320,000 children, and followed their health for many years. There was a slight increase in risk of Type 1 diabetes between the scheduled and unscheduled C-sections, which the story uses as a window for interviews with experts about speculation on how vaginal birth benefits babies. But the story misses key points about baseline differences in the women giving birth in three ways, which may have impacted the findings. Additionally, the story only discusses the increased risk (from the hazard ratios given) in relative percent increase, not absolute increase. This results in a misleading description of the findings and the size of the risk. Moreover, the study itself carefully warns that the results don’t prove any causation between the style of birth and the risk.

A large retrospective study suggests surgery could help stage 4 breast cancer patients survive longer. The Post evaluates this claim thoroughly.

This story is about a large retrospective study that was published this week in the journal JAMA Surgery. The research suggests women who opted for surgery to treat their breast cancer had better survival rates than those who didn’t, even though the number of surgeries has plunged from 1988 to 2011.
This Washington Post report does many things well: It quantifies the benefits of breast surgery in absolute terms, points out the study’s limitations and doesn’t make sweeping recommendations based on this research. Furthermore, the story uses cautionary language, making readers really question whether surgery is the better option for stage 4 breast cancer patients. It also incorporates two independent sources who provide some critical perspectives, such as the two other small studies that showed no correlation between surgery and survival in this group of women.

This Fox News article describes an experimental fertility treatment called in vitro maturation (IVM) that modifies the “gold standard” IVF (in vitro fertilization) for use in a subset of women for whom the IVF regimen is not an option. The article is less a “news” story than a “Q and A,” and it does a pretty good job overall of making clear that IVM is not for everyone and that controlled clinical trials have not been done to scientifically compare it to IVF in terms of success rates and fetal outcomes. Apart from the lack of critical information about comparative costs and risks of IVF and IVM or other forms of fertility treatments, the article avoids disorder mongering and readers/viewers will come away with a reasonable understanding of IVM’s limitations and uses.
What is a bit problematic, perhaps, is why the article is appearing now. 
There are, for example, no recent or new data or studies cited; the latest one this article appears to refer to is from a 2014 article by a group at the Technion in Israel. The procedure has been around for about a decade. So the article comes across as a bit of an “ad” for private-practice, commercial fertility clinics that offer IVM.

Overall, this CNN piece could have been made stronger by having outside experts comment on the findings, as the STAT piece did to excellent effect; by offering more qualitative details about the sources of the data; by noting that in excessive quantities, the new study identified a slight increase in risk of death; and — as the STAT piece did superbly, noting the likely “benefits” in terms of absolute risk (very, very small).",fake,1172,504,77,1753

But the story swallows a bit too easily the claim that better diets “have saved more than one million people from dying prematurely.” While that’s certainly possible, the claim is based on modeling from observational studies that can’t prove cause and effect — so it’s inappropriate to suggest, based on these types of studies, that dietary changes “saved” anyone.

Update: The Times has issued a correction to this story. The correction states that the story erroneously claimed that the experimental approach in the study used lower drug dosages. “Though it studied a program intended to reduce medication dosages, the researchers do not yet know for sure if dosages were lowered or by how much,” the correction notes.”Therefore, the study did not conclude ‘that schizophrenia patients who received smaller doses of antipsychotic medication and a bigger emphasis on one-on-one talk therapy and family support made greater strides in recovery.’ (The study did conclude that the alternative treatment program as a whole led to better outcomes.)”
We changed the headline of our review from “Times captures impact of new, less drug-intensive schizophrenia treatment” to “Times explores impact of integrated care model for schizophrenia treatment.” The correction does not affect our ratings for the story, but the references we made in the review to the lowered drug dosages are no longer appropriate and have been stricken. In addition, the tone of the review would have been more circumspect had we known that the intended reduction in drug dosages had not been confirmed by the researchers.
In a large randomized controlled trial in 34 community clinics across the U.S., researchers compared usual care for first episode psychosis with a program of integrated care that included not only drugs, but also help with school and work, family education about the problems and how best to help, as well as one-on-one talk therapy. The government (National Institute of Mental Health)-funded study found that those receiving the integrated program of care experienced more symptom relief and functioned better than those in the treatment-as-usual group. Their doses of medication were also 20-50% lower. Those receiving treatment earlier on in their psychotic episodes also did better.

While the story finds that it can be less expensive and time-consuming to have the bilateral knee replacement, it also reports that bilateral replacement surgery may pose increased health risks for patients.
The coverage overall is thorough and gives readers a good sense of the tradeoffs involved with each approach. The inclusion of more details about the “better outcomes” achieved in some studies of bilateral replacement would have been a valuable addition to the piece.",real,57,10,0,67

According to the Associated Press article on the study, more than 100,000 women in the US are diagnosed with this type.
Doctors usually remove the tumor via surgery and prescribe hormone-blocking drugs, but they are unsure whether chemotherapy can offer additional benefits for some women. In this NEJM study, patients with this common breast cancer took a gene test to see whether their tumors would respond well to hormone-blocking drugs alone. Those labeled “low risk” based on this gene test skipped chemo and saw they had a very low rate of cancer recurrence within five years.
The Associated Press article touches upon all the main points – costs of the gene test, study design and benefits, context – and we applaud how thoroughly the story addresses some of our criteria, especially on a tight deadline.

Can psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, Ayahuasca, an Amazonian brew, or MDMA, the active ingredient in the party drug Ecstasy help people who are addicted, anxious or depressed?  That’s the question increasingly asked by researchers who are testing these psychedelic drugs in small numbers of patients to see if they bring any relief.
As the article nicely points out, mental health problems like addiction or depression are thought of as chronic, lifelong diseases, but what if that’s an ineffective approach for many people? What if anxious or depressed people were, instead, treated by a small number of episodes of  profoundly perspective-altering drugs, which rewires one’s underlying personal philosophy and brings relief that way?  Would this not represent a dramatic paradigm-crushing approach to treating mental illness?

But the story never backs up the claim that these remedies work and are safe — information that is key to convincing the reader that the story’s claims are true and can be trusted. The story also misses the opportunity to explore how women may feel about menopause and whether some women’s reluctance to be treated reflects a legitimate, informed choice.

The study discussed in the story evaluated a very small group of people (22), meaning that it may be useful for determining whether it’s worthwhile to pursue a larger study — but that it is impossible to tell whether the iPad game would have any real impact on schizophrenia patients in general. Similarly, the story doesn’t make clear how much improvement the game provided for the patients who participated in the study. The story made a bit of a leap in saying the training helped participants “in their daily lives at home and at work.” Statistical significance was reached on a scale that attempts to measure functioning at home and work, but it’s too much to say with this small group and short-term study whether it actually made a difference.

This story looks at two classes of drugs – aromatase inhibitors and bisphosphonates – which it says may deliver a “powerful one-two punch” when treating breast cancer. It reports on two Lancet studies that compiled data from 9 and 26 trials, respectively – what are known as meta-analyses.

A poor-quality news release spawned weak coverage from the CBC, which is paraphrased here by Fox with even less context and nuance. Failure on many levels.

This Fox News story demonstrates anew that repeating a weak story does not strengthen it. The brief account reports that Canadian researchers have developed a “new pill” that may do for people with celiac disease (CD) what lactase enzyme tablets do for those with intolerance to lactose-rich dairy foods: make it easy and possible for them to enjoy foods they must currently avoid. The story claims that a pill composed of egg yolk-derived antibodies that prevent gluten protein absorption “may help” diners enjoy pizza and beer by popping it just before digging in. On the upside, the report does quote the pill’s developer cautioning that the “antibody supplement” won’t treat or cure celiac disease. On the more egregious downside, however, the story more or less presents the pill as a done deal, which it is not; and it offers not a word about the research underpinning the claim, which appears to be based on work done only in cell culture — not even rodents. There have been no clinical trials (which the story mentions in the last sentence), and the entire report seems to be rehash of a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation story, which in turn was based on a vague news release issued by the University of Alberta.

The story also attempts to address whether it is better walk, jog, or run in order to achieve the desired reduction in risk. Ultimately, the story makes three statements: some exercise reduces the risk of death (in a given year); light to moderate jogging (between 5 and 7 miles per hour) is the optimal pace; and if you do 25 minutes of jogging at this pace, three times per week, “you’re all set.” Although the language used in places is not as precise as we’d like (based on the available evidence, we can’t really say whether exercise at a given intensity “reduces” death risk as the story states, merely that it is “associated with” lower risk), the coverage overall is thorough and balanced.

The article does a pretty good job of setting out the limited and sometimes terrible therapeutic options such patients face, but the tone overall is promotional and there is no discussion of the costs or harms associated with the device. There is also no “news” context for the article, or answer to the question, “why is this information news now?” No recent clinical trial data are cited, and it appears that the last published clinical trial was in 2013, a phase I study of 10 patients, which saw modest life extension for some patients, along with serious side effects in most, including brain swelling.

(Interestingly, there is an ongoing retrospective registry sponsored by the company to determine outcomes with no results as yet.) Overall, the information in the piece is accurate with respect to the challenges neurosurgeons and their patients face, but it’s a mystery why U.S. News & World Report (USN&WR) chose to “cover” the topic at this point in time; why a neurosurgeon was chosen to present it as a piece of journalism; and why no other sources were cited that might have updated the information and made it newsworthy.",fake,22,23,0,45

This report includes links to numerous meta-analyses about the effects of coffee on a wide range of health impacts including heart disease, cancer, diabetes, liver disease, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. The underlying assumption is that coffee has a bad rap that is not deserved, given the vast amount of evidence that has accumulated about its potential benefits over the years. One might be tempted to pour an additional cup every morning if, as the article suggests: “the potential health benefits are surprisingly large.”
While this is a compelling and intriguing report that reflects considerable research by the author, one can’t help but think it suffers from a bit of confirmation bias which is described as: “the tendency to search for, interpret, or recall information in a way that confirms one’s beliefs or hypotheses.” Seems that when the Times went out to look for research on the effects of coffee — both the good and the bad — the bad wasn’t generally found. What would have helped was some sense of bias that might creep into the available coffee-related research, that it is mostly observational, and hence subject to a variety of limitations that are less likely found in randomized studies. Nearly every study of coffee consumption relies on peoples’ perceptions and recall of how much coffee they thought they drank, and we know that recall bias would affect all of those studies where self-reported behaviors are being measured. What the reader needs, up front, in an article such as this is a more rigorous probing of the common confounders in observational research, the potential for bias (including publication bias, reporting bias, social responsibility bias, and others) and so on. We suspect that there may even be healthy user bias and the possibility, even remote, that the people who respond to surveys about how much coffee they drink are not representative of the general population and hence the study results are less likely to be seen in the “real world.”",fake,3630,950,229,4809

A solid piece of reporting that focuses on the safety of a medical device used to prevent strokes. Its discussion of FDA rules governing device approvals is valuable.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cause of rapid, irregular heartbeat that puts people at increased risk for stroke. Approving new devices or surgical techniques to help reduce risk for these patients is important, and so this story is important for helping raise the alarm about a device that might not be safe enough and might need further testing. This story does a good job with several layers of complexity — how the regulatory process may have a loophole, the freedom doctors have to use devices off-label, and the new study that concludes by recommending surgeons should hold off on using the new Lariat device until more studies are done. These strengths notwithstanding, the story could have done a better job of describing current practices to prevent strokes in patients with AF and how this device may or may not be an additional option. It is known that a variety of blood thinners can significantly decrease the risk of stroke in patients with AF. However, there are risks associated with these blood thinners, including bleeding (including life-threatening bleeds in the brain that can be as serious as the effect of the blood clot they are trying to prevent), that mean not all patients can use them.",real,8,4,0,12

This story did a reasonable job of reporting on a study about the use of massage to treat infertility. It would’ve been stronger had it pointed out the study’s high dropout rate.

This story reports on a retrospective study looking at a form of massage therapy that is designed to treat infertility, with the claim that it is an alternative to surgery or in-vitro fertilization (IVF) in dealing with blocked fallopian tubes. The theory is that massage may help remove adhesions— scar tissue that forms after surgery, infection or trauma and can block fallopian tubes, preventing pregnancy. This concept may have appeal for women who wish to avoid invasive treatment. The story earns points for including a valuable comment from an infertility expert, who rightfully points to some of the many limitations in the study used to back the claim that massage therapy is effective for tubal infertility.

The story doesn’t convey that nuance, and emphasizes instead that risk of heart attacks was cut in half with these drugs.

This short article tells a compelling story of a life saved because of bystander CPR, and uses a gathering of such survivors and their saviors to encourage others to learn CPR. It makes an emotional pitch for the value of CPR by non-medical personnel, and leaves readers with the clear implication that CPR is an emergency measure with a proven, high success rate, even in the hands of amateurs. And therein is the problem. CPR does save lives, but at a rate many experts acknowledge is astonishingly low, even when performed by EMTs, physicians, and nurses in hospital settings. It’s hard to fault a story that may prompt  “civilians” to get potentially life-saving CPR training, but readers would have been much better served to also hear about the substantial downsides to CPR,  urgent need for public support of further CPR research, and alternatives to current CPR resuscitation efforts, such as the out-of-hospital use of automated external defibrillators, also known as AEDs.

A comparison of two diagnostic tests — traditional stress tests and newer heart CTA (computed tomography angiogram) scans — among more than 10,000 heart patients found no difference in those patients’ incidence of subsequent heart attacks and related complications, suggesting that the two types of testing work equally well. Further, that incidence—3 percent—was so low that researchers suggested that “watchful waiting” may be a viable alternative to such diagnostic tests. Missing from this story is any reflection on cost; other researchers have found that the CT scan is associated with much higher health care spending rates. We also thought the story could have done without a misleading closing anecdote that badly undercuts the main message of the story.",real,150,63,4,217

This story notes that vegetarians had a 22% lower risk of colorectal cancer compared with non-vegetarians. But that 22% difference translates to only 1.4 fewer cases for every 10,000 people in the study. We think it’s helpful for readers to know that.

The story summarizes a recent paper in JAMA Internal Medicine that reports a vegetarian diet is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. The story goes into some detail on the decreased risk for various types of vegetarian diets, and discusses some of the uncertainty regarding what may be responsible for the correlation between diet and cancer risk. However, the story never gives readers an accurate breakdown of the primary limitations of the study, and the statistics used in the story will give readers an inflated sense of the benefits. Not only is the reduction in cancer risk very small in absolute terms, but many of the results mentioned were not statistically significant.

The provocative headline for this story might have things backwards.

This story was about an observational study suggesting a link between sexual activity/fulfillment and better cognitive function in older people. A story that did more than scratch the surface of this study would have uncovered an obvious limitation: Older people sometimes aren’t healthy enough to have good (or any) sex, and seniors who aren’t healthy enough for sex probably also have brains that are less healthy than their sexually fulfilled peers. So suggesting that sex “leads to a sharper mind” is an oversimplification of what’s going on here.

The story accurately quantifies the potential benefits of delivering lidocaine via a specialized procedure performed by an interventional radiologist, and it rightfully cautions against the limitations of a small, short-term study presented at a scientific meeting.

We credit this story for tackling an interesting issue related to drug costs — something few stories we look at cover in any depth. But we have concerns about this story’s overall treatment of the issue and its exploration of the evidence. In its attempt to explain why so few healthy gay men in the U.S. are taking the drug Truvada to prevent HIV infections — a use that is recommended by the CDC — this story suggests that: 1) manufacturer Gilead is not marketing the drug sufficiently to primary care physicians, and 2) high costs are an obstacle to treatment for many people.
But the business angle is just one aspect of this multifaceted story. There are also legitimate concerns about whether the drug is as effective as is claimed, and the issue of preexposure prophylaxis or “PrEP” is controversial among HIV/AIDS healthcare experts.

The pill described in this story is the first product of Elysium Health, a new company formed with the backing of many leading researchers in the field. The company claims to be science and data driven and suggests that its product is superior to other dietary supplements that haven’t been scientifically validated. We think the story should have been more forceful in exposing the hypocrisy of that stance. The company says it will provide evidence to support its claims at some point in the future, but it is selling the supplements NOW. So it is essentially doing the same thing that other unscrupulous supplement sellers are doing — enriching themselves based on the “promise” of a product that hasn’t been shown to provide any health benefit. The fact that Nobel laureates are the ones doing it is unfortunate, since their stature will distract consumers from the emptiness of the company’s claims.
With all that being said, the article does inject some context and a healthy dose of skepticism into this trendy topic. It doesn’t accept the company’s claims without challenge. It juxtaposes the big name affiliations of the company’s leaders and advisers with the uncertainty surrounding their wares. We just think it should have done more on that front and put it higher up in the story.",fake,148,28,17,193

This story about the benefits of vitamins reads like a primer on how not to approach health journalism. Our story review focuses on the evidence presented; see

This first-person story — and its headline — claim to present new evidence to end any question about the life-saving, disease-preventing value of population-wide use of megadose multivitamin supplements. The second half of this 700-plus-word piece goes on to offer tips for purchasing supplements that are “high quality” brands, and warning consumers to  avoid “cheaper” pills that might skimp on benefits or contain harmful ingredients. These “higher-quality” brands are conveniently available on the author’s linked website, making this story little more than an ad in the guise of news. Financial conflicts aside, the story’s claims about vitamin benefits are overstated and deceptive opinions based on cherry-picked studies, and the research described as “new” was actually published in 2012. More recent recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, based on a systematic review of all available clinical trials, conclude that there is “inadequate evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of supplements of single or paired vitamins, multivitamins, or minerals to prevent CVD or cancer.”",fake,264,41,4,309

An initial version of this story had a trippy quote from one of the study researchers. We’re glad that this sensational language and other deficiencies were addressed in subsequent editing. The revised version is much better.

The story does a nice job of reviewing previous research on psychedelic drugs and mental illness, and it does eventually address what science views at the major limitation of the observational study being reported on — the fact that it can’t tell us whether psychedelic drug use actually caused the reduction in suicidal thoughts and attempts that the study authors found.

The story does a very nice job of describing the problem (that some people have muscle aches or side effects from statins), and that this extract appears to result in cholesterol reductions without those same side effects. The story could have done a better job explaining what the observed reductions in cholesterol might mean for someone’s overall cardiovascular risk, and describing the potential harms of taking unregulated supplements.

This insightful piece explores the cost-benefit tradeoffs of Mohs surgery — a procedure that involves excising cancerous skin tumors and immediately examining them with a microscope to confirm that the entire tumor is removed. But it’s a bit one-sided: the story does not address the harms and limitations of the procedure. And the cost issues raised by the story are not as thoroughly explored as we’d have liked.

The use of Mohs surgery has skyrocketed over the past few years – 248 percent from 1996 to 2008, according to Medicare data. The procedure is heralded as being the “preferred treatment” for certain types of skin cancer and boasts a cure rate of 98 to 99 percent. But Mohs is relatively expensive, costing about $200 more than excision, another standard therapy.
The story focuses on the financial aspects of Mohs and weighs that against the perceived benefits patients receive when choosing this therapy over other alternatives.

We found no glaring problems with the reporting of this valid story, so it gets a top 5-star score.  But we question whether the subject matter warranted front-page attention in a 2,000-word article.

We’re not in the habit of criticizing news organizations for devoting too much space to stories that debunk dubious health claims. But with so many important health stories screaming for attention, we think it’s legitimate to question the Times’s investment of resources in this particular issue. Since there’s almost no human research on the health effects of energy drinks, the question of whether or not they work shouldn’t take very long to address. And we think there was room to discuss the serious health hazards that have been increasingly linked to these products in greater detail.

And we realize that there’s a counter-argument to be made about the significance of this coverage.

The statistically significant reductions in blood pressure reported by the story were found only in men (a subgroup representing only half the participants whose results should be interpreted very cautiously), at a specific timepoint (6 hours after ingestion), and only after the authors adjusted their analysis for baseline differences between the beet juice and placebo groups. Experts differ about the appropriateness of such statistical tinkering in a randomized trial, another reason why this result should be viewed very carefully.
So the overall conclusion should have been that beet juice did not lower blood pressure (at least not a statistically significant degree), and that there were some interesting trends suggesting a possible benefit that needs confirmation in stronger studies.

The comment that a biopsy is the only way to look at “the tumor cells and decide how dangerous the cancer is” is confusing.  For men with an elevated PSA, the biopsy is the only way to determine whether they HAVE cancer.  For men with low-risk cancers who are undergoing active surveillance (such as the subjects in the study), the biopsy is a helpful test (along with PSA) to determine whether the cancer is becoming more dangerous.  The US Preventive Services Task Force advised against routine screening because they concluded that the net benefit (prostate cancer deaths prevented) was outweighed by the harms (overdiagnosis, treatment complications).

<span style=""font-size: small;"">Journalists tread on risky ground when they summarize the results of a new study and then neglect to provide ANY independent commentary.</span>

An independent expert can point out whether a study is valid and relevant and whether any cautionary notes should accompany its conclusions.




The article provided an accurate, bare-bones description of the study and its main conclusions—that yoga and intensive stretching were similarly effective and were both superior to the self-care intervention.
But it also missed several key points, as detailed in the scoring below. And since the study in the Archives of Internal Medicine was actually accompanied by an independent commentary that could have been cited, these omissions are all the more telling.
So what points might an independent expert have added to the coverage?The most important one is that the subjects in this study were relatively affluent and generally had mild back pain and modest functional limitations. The results of this study may not apply to the large body of patients from less affluent backgrounds with more severe back pain, greater functional impairment, and more complex health problems.
Would a roughneck on an oil rig, an auto mechanic, or a hotel maid gain a similar benefit from yoga or intensive stretching as the subjects in this study? No one really knows.
The availability of these treatments is also an issue. Similarly structured viniyoga programs may not be available in many communities—and it is not clear that most health insurance plans will cover them. The type of intensive stretching program described in this study would appear to be uncommon in the United States. So most patients wouldn’t have access to this intervention.
Lastly, this study did not compare yoga and intensive stretching to “usual care”. So yoga and intensive stretching may be superior to a self-care program, but it is not as clear that they are any better than routine back care as dispensed across the United States.",fake,573,95,0,668

<span style=""font-size: small;"">Is the benefit of yoga for chronic back pain more physical than mental? This story led with this point in its headline and opening paragraph—and thereby got off on the wrong foot.</span>

It is an interesting point to explore, since the study authors mentioned it as well. But the journalist could have dug a little deeper and noticed the study was never designed to prove this point—and didn’t. So the Wall St. Journal led with a mischaracterization of the study results.
The study found that yoga and intensive stretching exercises were equally effective in relieving pain and enhancing function—and that both were superior to a self-care educational booklet in the management of chronic back pain at the primary study endpoint of 12 weeks.
“Finding similar effects for both approaches suggests that yoga’s benefits were largely attributable to the physical benefits of stretching and not to its mental component,” the authors wrote in the discussion section.
But this is just an opinion. And it is just as possible that both group interventions—yoga and intensive stretching—had physical and mental benefits in the management of low back pain. A recent article in the Lancet pointed out that the causes of low back pain are generally obscure, as are the mechanisms of pain relief. (See Balagué et al., 2011)
The Wall St. Journal article offered a brief but useful description of the study, its background, and context. But as with a New York Times article on the same topic, there was a hole in the coverage. The journalist included the views of the study authors but offered no perspectives from independent experts.
The study had an important limitation that should have at least been mentioned. The researchers studied relatively affluent subjects with mild, uncomplicated back pain that did not result in substantial functional problems.
So the results may not apply to the individuals who bear the heaviest burden from chronic back pain and related disability: those on the lower rungs of the socioeconomic ladder, those with medicolegal dilemmas in the workplace, and those with other more complicated mental and physical health problems.
The study also did not compare yoga to the “usual treatments” for low back pain offered in the U.S. medical system. So yoga’s overall benefits may not be quite as clear as the Wall St. Journal article suggests.",fake,316,32,0,348

story_reviews_01054,"Study Questions Chiropractic’s Impact on Back Pain

<span style=""font-size: small;"">This story touched on an important truth about the treatment of chronic back pain—even if it missed some key points along the way. </span>

The article focused on a recent systematic review of the effectiveness of spinal manipulation for chronic low back pain.  The Cochrane Collaboration review found that this popular treatment leads to rapid short-term pain relief and improvement in function.
But the magnitude of the treatment effect was modest at best. And manipulation did not provide a “clinically significant” advantage over other common treatments for chronic low back pain, according to this review.
The HealthDay article made a key observation about chronic back pain: that there is no “silver bullet” for it. And it provided a brief but fair description of the systematic review and the evidence it considered.  Our reviewers could have gone either way on several of the graded criteria, so the 4-star final score may be a bit deceiving.
What were some of the shortcomings of this article? The article had a misleading title: “Study Questions Chiropractic’s Impact on Back Pain”.
This systematic review looked at the effects of manipulation as practiced by multiple professions rather than the impact of chiropractic per se. Since the review concluded that manipulation is a viable treatment for chronic back pain, one can argue that it supports rather than questions this manual therapy.
It might have been useful to ask an impartial expert how the new review on manipulation compares with other recent reviews of the evidence in this area. And how manipulation compares with other effective treatments for chronic back pain.
Readers of this article might well have come away with the impression that all treatments for chronic back pain offer similar results. This is not the case.
Of the 200 or so therapies for chronic back pain in the medical marketplace, no treatment consistently offers a major benefit. Only a few have been proven to provide a moderate benefit for chronic back pain.
The most influential U.S. guideline found only six treatments, including manipulation, where there was “good” evidence of a “moderate benefit” for chronic back pain (See Chou et al., 2007; Chou et al., 2009).
An influential British review concluded that three general approaches (exercise, manual therapy including manipulation, and acupuncture) provide roughly equal benefit in the early management of persistent back pain. (See NICE, 2009).
So the new review on manipulation is reasonably consistent with the larger evidence picture.
It would have been useful if the article could have highlighted this point—since it offers an important message for people with chronic back pain. Based on this body of evidence, they shouldn’t be expecting heroic cures. Rather, they should look for validated treatments that can help them stay comfortable and active—and that align with their values, expectations and tolerance for risk.

Given the aggressive treatments that some people pursue for chronic low back pain, it is important for journalists to report research that points to a benefit from non-surgical therapies as well.
This isn’t the first study of massage for low back pain. Prior studies haven’t shown much benefit for low back pain that is less than 1 month in duration, but prior studies have shown benefit for those with pain for more than 3 months (chronic). As such these results aren’t breaking new ground. What it does show is that two forms of massage give similar results and that the benefits of massage in terms of pain diminish over time. Massage did show peristent improvement in function at 26 weeks. At 52 weeks function was better in the relaxation massage group but not the structural massage group when compared to usual care (though the direct comparison of the two massage groups didn’t significantly differ).
In summary, this study adds to the evidence that massage provides short-term benefit for patients with chronic low back pain that diminishes over time in terms of pain, but maintains its benefit in terms of function. This is good news, but it isn’t a cure.",fake,258,51,0,309

<span style=""font-size: small;"">Our 3 reviewers felt that the story attempted balance, but that overall it was overly optimistic about the ability of knee &amp; hip replacement surgery to return middle-agers with painful osteoarthritis to pain-free, athletic lives.</span>

This article looked at this issue through the positive short-term experiences of six individuals who opted for joint replacement in mid-life.
They all seemed to be exuberantly active and have splendid outcomes after emerging from post-operative rehabilitation. The six recipients of artificial knees and hips were collectively able to engage in long-distance cycling, kite-boarding, motorcycling, yoga, pilates, strength training and basketball.
One woman reported that her pain and limitations were completely gone.  “I never imagined my life could be so wonderful,” she commented.
Although several of the subjects were pushing the envelope in terms of stressing their implanted joints with high-impact activities, not a single one reported a problem, a complication, or a functional limitation when they returned to normal activity.
In a country where more than half of adults are overweight, and almost half are completely sedentary, the joint replacement patients in the Wall St. Journal article are far from the norm. It is hard to imagine that these six individuals are representative of patients who opt for joint replacement in middle age across the United States.
The story did attempt to balance the idealized view of joint replacement in the patient vignettes with cautionary notes from several surgeons. These invited experts pointed out that artificial joint recipients should avoid high-impact sports and that the durability of joints implanted in mid-life remains uncertain. Given the views of these experts, some tough questioning of the patients could have shown the reader that these individuals may be experiencing short-term benefits at the expense of long-term misery—if their implants ultimately fail.
More references to scientific studies would have been welcome. The article never reported the overall success rate of knee and hip replacement in younger patients.  Or the degree to which these procedures lead to an increased level of activity. It gave short shrift to one of the key questions about joint replacement in middle-age. In terms of pain, function, and adverse advents, what are the projected outcomes of the revision procedures that appear to be inevitable for surgeries performed at this age?
And the article never got into the thorny question as to whether the surge in knee and hip replacement in younger patients might represent over-utilization of these surgical procedures—or at least premature use.
A recent commentary in Arthritis Care & Research suggested that patients and their doctors in the United States rely excessively on analgesics and joint replacement to treat osteoarthritis of the knee and hip—and are under-utilizing evidence-based treatments, such as weight loss and exercise programs, that might delay these operations.

A feature on the National Public Radio (NPR) website proclaimed an alternative therapy known as “The Alexander Technique” to be “highly effective” in the treatment of chronic back pain. But what does “highly effective” mean in real world terms—for a condition considered resistant to effective treatment? 
Does the Alexander Technique—which educates patients on posture, movement and neuromuscular coordination—find strong support in multiple clinical trials? Is the therapy more effective than common evidence-based treatments for chronic back pain? Is it cost-effective? Unfortunately, the NPR story never provided answers to any of these questions. 
Instead, it examined the value of this therapy through the prism of two individuals heavily invested in its success: (1) a jazz trumpeter attempting to use the Alexander Technique to work through his chronic back symptoms; and (2) a therapist who makes a living teaching these methods. 
The article included brief comments from the British researcher who led a clinical trial showing the Alexander Technique to be superior to six sessions of massage and an uNPRoven exercise program. But the journalist highlighted only the most positive results from this study, and none of its potential limitations—of which there are several. (See BackLetter, 2008). And the writer didn’t seek out dispassionate commentary from any independent experts, much to the article’s detriment. 
So what might those experts have said about the Alexander Technique? They might have pointed out that the Alexander approach to chronic low back pain has been examined in only a single randomized clinical trial.  To be persuasive, these results would need to be confirmed in other clinical settings. Though they are promising and warrant further investigation, it isn’t clear if these findings represent a breakthrough, a further option for individuals with low back pain, or a false hope. 
At present there is no evidence that the Alexander Technique is more effective than other common evidence-based treatments for chronic low back pain—from manual therapies to structured exercise programs to multidisciplinary rehabilitation.  A recent systematic review performed for the British National Health Service concluded that all of these may be viable options for chronic back pain—but that none stood out as superior. (See NICE, 2009). So calling the Alexander Technique “highly effective” may be a bit of a reach.
In addition, the cost-effectiveness of this approach remains very much up in the air. In the clinical trial cited above, the Alexander Technique (which involved either six or 24 visits with a therapist) proved less cost-effective than a simple exercise program. (See NICE, 2009)
So should individuals with chronic or recurrent back pain consider the Alexander Technique as a treatment option? That would be a reasonable response. However, they should opt for this treatment approach only after taking a balanced look at both its potential strengths and its weaknesses—a process this article didn’t facilitate.

A review of studies about zinc’s benefits for preventing and treating the common cold was handled in slightly different — but important — ways by three outlets: WebMD, the New York Times and Reuters Health. WebMD hit fewer of our marks because it did not make cost information clear, muddied the waters in its analysis of the evidence and failed to quantify the benefits of zinc in a transparent way. We think it did a nice job explaining the science behind zinc’s effect on colds, and it provided some good details about the possible harms associated with taking zinc.
But Reuters took a much more cautious approach – and appropriately so – with a headline that “Zinc will help your cold, at least a little”.  And the opening sentences:  “may take the edge off the common cold. But not a whole lot.”",fake,117,1,0,118

But let’s not lose sight of the strong points:  for the second straight day, Reuters Health (and this same reporter) led with caution while others trumpeted findings.  Note how the WebMD had an early quote, “This is great news.” And the NY Times’ first sentence said it “may be the next best thing” to a cure.  To quote the title of an evidence-based health care column in the Times, “Really?”",fake,373,8,0,381

<span style=""font-size: small;"">This article tackled an impossibly broad question and ended up with a vague and murky answer. It tried to take on an important topic, but in seeking broad generalizations, didn’t provide the reader with much useful information.</span>

The question posed in the article is basically the following:  “Are shoe inserts (foot orthotics) effective in the prevention and treatment of injuries among athletes?”’

Why is this impossibly broad? This question encompasses dozens of musculoskeletal, neurologic, and degenerative conditions involving scores of scientific studies. It would have been better for the article to define its scope more narrowly—e.g., foot injuries, lower limb injuries, or low back pain— and look at the evidence more carefully.
Gazing through the prism of a single scientist’s work, the article presents an interesting narrative about the difficulties of performing biomechanical and clinical research in this area. And it endorses a skeptical attitude in interpreting the claims of proponents in this multi-billion dollar industry.
However, the answer to the main question is fundamentally unsatisfying—and “soft” from an evidence perspective: “Shoe inserts may be helpful as a short-term solution, preventing injuries in some athletes,” according to the New York Times.
This is a soft statement because almost any prevention method or treatment will help somebody over the short-term some of the time.  And this permissive conclusion will certainly not deter athletes from seeking out orthotics for dozens of conditions on the premise that they might work.
However, this broad-brush conclusion doesn’t adequately characterize the evidence regarding shoe inserts. That evidence cleaves a little more neatly than this article implies.
By conventional medical standards (well-designed clinical trials) there is no conclusive evidence that shoe inserts are effective in the prevention and treatment of the majority of athletic injuries.
There are a few conditions for which there is preliminary evidence that shoe inserts may offer modest preventive or therapeutic benefits.
But importantly, and never mentioned in this article, there are also conditions in which the effectiveness of shoe inserts has been tested and disproven.

<span style=""font-size: small;"">Starting with the “Injecting migraine pain away” headline and continuing through a string of inputs from people on the Botox payroll, this story may have left readers with an unbalanced picture. </span>

A therapy for headache once given up for dead has achieved a surprising reincarnation—and a growing niche in the medical marketplace.  But does it deserve its newfound reputation as an effective treatment? The answer is “probably not.” But a Wall Sreet. Journal article never makes that clear. It oversold the efficacy of the treatment, soft-pedaled potential side-effects, and didn’t adequately emphasize that the results of this treatment are somewhat marginal.
Clinical trials in the past showed that injections of Botulinum toxin A—i.e., Botox—were ineffective in the management of tension headaches, daily headaches and episodic migraines.  An editorial in a prominent headache journal in 2006 suggested these studies marked the “end of the road” for Botox in the management of headache. (See Evers and Olesen, 2006)
But two recent clinical trials indicate that Botox injections may be somewhat effective in the prevention of chronic migraines, defined as headaches lasting at least four hours per day for at least 15 days per month.
Based on these clinical trials, the FDA recently decided to approve the marketing of Botox for this indication.  (See Aurora et al., 2010; Diener et al., 2010). However, the jury is still out on the long-term viability of this prevention strategy. Some prominent headache researchers opposed the regulatory approval of Botox for chronic migraines, pointing out that the modest advantage of Botox over dummy injections might be explained by study issues and placebo effects. (See Olesen and Tfelt-Hansen, 2010)
Newly approved therapies for difficult pain conditions often reach clinical practice without adequate evidence regarding their risks and benefits. Such is the case with Botox. This poses a challenge for patients and journalists alike.
How much weight should they give to company-sponsored studies? How seriously should they take the views of experts who have a financial relationship with the company? How should they interpret therapies that have never been compared to other standard treatments? And how much credence should they give to a treatment that only has about a 10% advantage over placebo injections? (See Olesen and Tfelt-Hansen, 2010)
On the surface, an article in the Wall Street Journal navigated this tricky area competently. It provided a skeletal description of the two trials. The journalist clearly identified the evidence from the two studies as conflicting. The article presented both enthusiastic and skeptical views of the effectiveness of Botox.
But the article veered too close to the viewpoint of Botox proponents. It quoted a researcher who is also a senior vice-president of the company that developed this injection therapy—as well as experts who have financial relationships with this company.  It didn’t adequately describe some of the potential flaws in the two clinical trials.
And it didn’t specify the need for further independent research to document that this treatment actually provides a clinically significant treatment advantage—and not just a statistically significant advantage over injections of a salt solution.",fake,40,7,0,47

Given how many people take statins in the US and how heavily marketed they are to everyone else, we think this story — and others — needed to take a more critical look at the evidence behind the claims that statins can significantly reduce strokes and heart attacks.

This is a story on the results of two recently published studies that found that more intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol levels was associated with greater reductions in future risk of cardiac outcomes. While there was good information about the sorts of outcomes that were reduced in the group using the increased dose of the statins, there was not a thorough analysis of the evidence. On the plus side, the story did mention that cancer outcomes were not affected by the change in cardiovascular events, and the story did include information about the harms associated with statin medication. The story also, however, had a few modest errors. It said, for example, “The reduction in LDL cholesterol from the higher dose ended up decreasing the risk of a major cardiac event by 6 percent, the researchers found, although the statistic in itself was not clinically significant.” We think they meant not statistically significant. Elsewhere, the story says, “Researchers also found that seven participants had creatine kinase levels higher than 40 times the upper limit of normal — a possible indicator of kidney damage.” Creatine kinase (CK) is an indicator of muscle damage.

The story brought clarity to a complicated and confusing topic. It offered important take-home messages for patients and healthcare providers alike—at least in the area of tennis elbow, where the evidence is most compelling.

A New York Times article asks the provocative question “Do steroid injections actually make things worse?”—referring to the treatment of chronic tendon problems such as tennis elbow, rotator cuff symptoms, jumper’s knee, and pain in the Achilles tendon.

The medical establishment has traditionally supported the view that steroid injections for tennis elbow can deliver remarkable short-term pain relief without compromising long-term outcomes.  However, in light of recent evidence, this appears to be an erroneous conclusion.
The new review found that the early pain relief provided by the injections comes at a substantial long-term cost.  All too often steroid injections appear to compromise the healing process. The pain relief at one month frequently gives way to increasing pain and disability at six months and one year.  Exercise, physical therapy, and doing nothing may all lead to better long-term outcomes.
So does the new review kill steroid injections as a treatment for tennis elbow? Not at all. But as the Times article pointed out, the new evidence will allow patients to carefully assess both the benefits and risks of steroid injections as well as other therapies.  And they will be able choose a treatment that aligns with their own goals and tolerance for risk.
As the journalist explained, the new systematic review could not find conclusive evidence about the short- or long-term benefits of steroid injections for other chronic tendon problems. But this is also an important conclusion. Those who choose steroid injections for rotator cuff problems, jumper’s knee, and Achilles’ symptoms can do so in the knowledge that they are opting for an uNPRoven therapy.
The New York Times article is not perfect. It did not fully address all of our criteria. It did not comprehensively characterize the pain outcomes for tennis elbow in easy-to-understand statistics—and did not provide any information on the costs of various approaches.  But these omissions relate largely to the way the systematic review expressed its composite results rather than a lack of work on the journalist’s part.
There were some live quotes in the article—with commentary from the senior author of the systematic review and one of the editorialists. Ideally, one would have liked to see additional commentary from someone not involved in either publication. However, finding someone familiar with all the evidence on steroid injections for tendon problems on short notice is a tall order.

Superb job of identifying major uncertainties surrounding the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of osteoporosis. In doing so, it cut through the fog of misinformation—some would say “hype”—that often surrounds this topic.

The scientific evidence in this area seems to be changing by the month—and those at potential risk of fractures need to stay informed about key developments. The Boston Globe article clearly gave women and men enough information to at least start a discussion with their doctors about these issues.
Many news stories on osteoporosis simply parrot the opinions of experts and present them as the last word on the subject. This article avoided that trap, clearly distinguishing the proven from uNPRoven, and opinion from fact.
It accurately observed that there is no conclusive evidence regarding the indications for, and the timing of, bone density screening. It hammered home the key point that rigorous scientific trials have not yet proven that screening prevents fractures.
The article identified the substantial uncertainties regarding the use of both calcium and vitamin D in the prevention of osteoporosis. It discussed the potential of hugely popular medications such as Fosamax and Boniva to prevent fractures—as well as to cause serious side effects such as cancer of the esophagus and pathological fractures of the thigh bone.
It there is a shortcoming in this article, it might be the way it presents medical decision-making in this area. At a couple of junctures, the story came close to endorsing traditional “doctor knows best” paternalistic decision-making.
 “In the absence of clear guidelines, many physicians make their own judgment calls,” the story suggested at one point. “Physicians face a tough choice when it comes to frail patient with brittle bones,” the story speculated at another.  Yet in medical encounters it is (or should be) the patient who is the ultimate decision-maker.
Only in the last paragraph did the article acknowledge the modern paradigm of shared decision-making, where informed patients make therapeutic decisions based on their values, goals and tolerance for risk.

The story focuses on results of a Swedish large study that showed a survival benefit from annual breast cancer screening for women in their 40s. This story also briefly reviews a recent study reported at the same conference, however, dealing with survival from breast cancer. Simply put, these are two separate issues (screening and survival) and it is very confusing to put the results and comments together in the same piece.
 Perhaps largely because the story doesn’t adequately evaluate the quality of the evidence of the new Swedish study, it has an unbalanced feel of promoting annual mammograms based on this recenty published data and via the selection of experts cited.  The downsides of screening for women 40-49 are not discussed at all.  
While this story begins telling readers that ""Another study…finds that screening can lower the risk of dying…"" –  look at how other competing stories began:

This story reported on a recent study that found that a man’s PSA level at age 60 was a useful indicator of his risk for developing aggressive prostate cancer within his lifetime.  While initially seeming to indicate that major groups concur that the decision to be screened for prostate cancer with this test should be a choice made by the individual man after discussion with his doctor, in the end – the story doles out clinical advice about when and how often men should be tested.  In so doing, the comment goes beyond what was supported by the study which is problematic.  In addition, although it is true that the study results reported on can be used by men to help inform their decision in terms about how to make use of their test results, the story did not appear to leave room for the man who decides against testing altogether.  Nonetheless – the story provides interesting information for men about one approach to using PSA test results to inform future decisions about testing.",real,201,26,0,227

Vague, inaccurate report on a very preliminary study.

While the story makes much of the new test’s potential to be a more accurate alternative to prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing, the current standard, it failed to include such basic information as how many samples were included in the study or how many false positives the new test generated. It also left readers with the unsupported impression that earlier detection of cancers — something the new test may be capable of — would be an unalloyed good for patients. In fact, we’re already finding and treating too many cancers that are so slow-growing that they would never cause a problem. What’s truly needed is a new test that can distinguish aggressive cancers from the low-risk ones.

What is the relevance of this athlete’s story to the ""weekend warrior"" in the readership?  We never learn, just as we never learn about costs, evidence, harms and the scope of benefits.

Anecdote and expert opinion triumphed over science and good journalism in a story on the regeneration of knee cartilage in USA Today. 
The article focused on autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), an expensive procedure intended to regenerate articular cartilage in the knee involving two operations and an arduous 18-month rehabilitation process.
Unwarranted Assumption of Benefit
From start to finish, the article seemed to assume that ACI is a beneficial treatment. It examined the outcomes of ACI through the prism of a single patient, who is apparently making a good recovery 12 months after the procedure.
That the journalist chose to present the experiences of a celebrity—Olympic swimmer Dara Torres—only adds to the allure of this invasive therapy. But it is certainly open to question whether the experiences of a highly disciplined Olympic athlete are generalizable to other patients undergoing this treatment.
The article offered a misleading statistic from Torres’ surgeon, who stated that 92% of his more than 600 patients have had “success” with ACI.
Yet the USA Today story never defined the indications for surgery in these patients— or what “success” meant.
No Mention of Scientific Evidence
In an era of evidence-based journalism, the article went astray in never citing a single scientific study or attempting to quantify the expected benefit of ACI.
It didn’t specify the availability or costs (an estimated $20-$35K) of this procedure. It didn’t address specific treatment alternatives for cartilage damage.
It didn’t discuss the possibility of adverse effects related to ACI. Yet in some studies, up to 50% of patients who opted for ACI have had to undergo an additional surgical procedure for cartilage problems down the road. (Genzyme, Highlights of Prescribing Information, Genzyme.com)
Two outside experts did offer some tempering remarks but didn’t actually question the effectiveness of ACI. And like the other contributors to this article, they didn’t cite a single scientific study.
What Does the Scientific Evidence Say?
A few sentences on the scientific evidence base for ACI would have brought the entire article into focus—and provided a real benefit for individuals considering this procedure.
And what does that evidence show? The most recent systematic review found evidence that ACI can provide benefit over the short-to-intermediate term. So its long-term effectiveness hasn’t been established. (Harris JD et al., AACI: Systematic Review, JBJS, Sept 15, 2010)
It is not clear if ACI is superior to many other common treatments for pain and dysfunction related to articular cartilage damage. Well-designed randomized trials comparing ACI to usual care would be valuable. 
So in short, while the evidence on ACI is promising, the jury is still out. This observation should have been the starting point for the USA Today article.",fake,58,10,0,68

The headline proclaims that the featured dental sealant means “Filling Cavities Without the Drill.” But the product is not actually approved to fill cavities, as the manufacturer’s web site puts it, the sealant “cannot be used in cases of advanced decay” and it “is not the same as a traditional filling.” The body of the story points out that the product is used on pits that are too small to be filled, in hopes of preventing further development, but readers are likely to be misled by the headline and lead paragraphs.
The story also calls the product new, but in its application for FDA approval the manufacturer said the sealant is “substantially equivalent” to other sealants that have been available for more than a decade.

The story ultimately failed to explore the issues that would make use of renin measurement problematic.  In addition, the story did readers a disservice by casting diuretics as being ""old and cheap,"" given that these are well-studied and proven medications that have had a tremendous impact on long-term clinical outcomes for patients with hypertension.",fake,326,1,0,327

Sometimes the frame can distract from the picture. This rare, clear-eyed assessment of the medical evidence about a pain reliever is upstaged by an overly enthusiastic headline, lead and anecdotal comments.

This story about topical gels that contain pain relief medication similar to ibuprofen makes a strong showing when examined point-by-point. Nevertheless, readers may end up with a skewed impression because of the personal anecdote and opinion that open and close the story. The headline and lead, as well as the last words of a story, can carry a lot of weight. The meat of the story includes a comprehensive overview of the medical evidence, but then there are phrases such as, “She raved about the stuff” and “for immediate relief of my tennis-related muscle pull, the cream was handy and helpful.” All the careful statements of fact in the body of the story may well be drowned out by the personal comments. 
This story includes something we see too rarely: it points out that much of the available medical evidence comes from clinical trials on ideal patients. These patients have simple problems and aren’t being treated for other serious conditions, and there is little information about how these medications work and what risks they may present to more typical patients, who often are dealing with multiple health conditions and taking several drugs that could interact.",real,143,7,0,150

A better test for TB is, indeed, reason for excitement, but this story glossed over some of the limitations of the research and failed to describe the real world limitations of making an expensive test widely available in cash-strapped countries.

This was a one-sided and potentially misleading story about a rapid new diagnostic test for tuberculosis (TB). The study discussed in the article assessed how accurate the new test was, but it couldn’t tell us whether the test improves treatment or leads to better health outcomes for TB patients. So when the story speculates in the headline that the new test has the ""potential to greatly improve treatment"" of TB,  we think this gets things off to a shaky start.

This story makes a one-side case for ‘minimally invasive"" rotator cuff surgery. 
This is an important topic: is “minimally invasive” arthroscopic surgery a safe and effective treatment for painful rotator cuff tears among men and women age 70 or over?
Unfortunately, the brief article never provided an adequate answer. It relied heavily on a press release. It didn’t offer a critical look at the study the press release promoted. It didn’t mention that the authors of the new study received funding from manufacturers of surgical equipment. It didn’t discuss costs.
Most importantly, the story didn’t provide a balanced view of the overall body of evidence on the treatment of rotator cuff tears.
Like the study and press release, the article suggested that arthroscopic rotator cuff surgery may be a safe and effective treatment for older patients—providing significant pain relief, improvements in strength and range of motion, and return to normal function.
These assertions could all be true. But the new study—a retrospective case series of 40 patients—has design issues that make it incapable of proving those points.
The same holds true for the larger body of evidence on the surgical treatment of rotator cuff tears.  A recent review of 137 studies sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research (AHRQ) suggested that there are many potential therapies, surgical and nonsurgical, for painful rotator tears.
However, all the evidence has flaws and no single treatment stands out above others, in terms of proven safety and effectiveness. (See Seida JC et al., Annals of Internal Medicine, July, 2010; see http://www.annals.org/content/early/2010/07/01/0003-4819-153-4-201008170-00263.full)

This in-depth (3400 word) report on cooling patients after cardiac arrest in order to reduce the risk of brain damage offers readers a wealth of detail on therapeutic hypothermia, the available evidence of its effects, and some of the apparent reasons most hospitals have yet to put it into routine use. The story specifically notes the small numbers of patients that have been studied in controlled trials, as well as the fact that many patients would need to be treated in order for one additional person to recover fully. The story also makes a potent case that institutional and individual inertia and resistance to change has slowed the adoption of this technique despite recommendations from leading professional groups.
However, the only patient featured in the story is a man who fully recovered. The powerfully emotional telling of his cardiac arrest, his treatment, the strain on his family and their joy at his recovery may overwhelm the hard data indicating that while cooling does appear to offer benefits (and no greater risk of harm), the overwhelming majority of such patients will not recover despite receiving therapeutic hypothermia.
We couldn’t ask for a more comprehensive statement of the available facts, and yet it seems likely that most readers will come away from the story believing that cooling has more powerful effects than even its strongest advocates would claim.",real,228,4,0,232

But here’s why that’s troubling in this case. The main text focuses almost exclusively on the ""breakthrough"" nature of the findings and speculates about how the new drug being studied might be used with other therapies to offer ""rare hope"" to patients with advanced melanoma. Critical details and caveats, however, are relegated to the ""Questions and Answers"" sidebar. 
One of our reviewers wrote that this story reminded him of one of those cell phone offers that has a great monthly rate but wallops you with fees in the fine print. 
We don’t mean to suggest that this story is intentionally misleading, but when the headline proclaims ""breakthrough"" and claims that the treatment ""may prolong life"" on the basis of a phase 1 study, we think that’s irresponsible. And the story’s structure further clouds the overall picture by playing up the benefits and making the caveats seem like an afterthought.

We’re sure that the columnist attempted a fair and balanced examination of the research challenges in this area rather than a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of acupuncture.

Let’s be clear:  this is a difficult topic.  But this article provided an overly optimistic view of acupuncture’s therapeutic effects by selectively reporting the results of four clinical trials.  These included two sham-controlled trials on the treatment of chronic knee pain and one sham-controlled trial on the management of chronic back pain.
Curiously, it also included discussion of a small study comparing acupuncture to an antidepressant for hot flashes among breast cancer patients.  By its design, this study wasn’t capable of separating the specific treatment effects of acupuncture from placebo responses. Yet it is presented as if it were relevant to this issue.
The column offered a variety of rationales on why acupuncture might not produce optimal results in conventional, sham-controlled clinical trials. But it didn’t balance out this discussion by considering whether the growing number of trials questioning acupuncture’s treatment impact might simply be correct.
The story included quotes from four researchers or independent experts. However, three of the four appeared to be proponents of acupuncture.
Revising Study Results
An example of the article’s apparent tilt towards acupuncture came in discussion of a recent trial on the treatment of painful knee osteoarthritis from Texas. That study concluded that both acupuncture and sham acupuncture produced identical improvements in pain scores: roughly one point on a seven-point scale (J-MAP).
However, the New York Times article proposed altering that conclusion through sleight-of-hand.  It noted that the patients would have received a different, non-standardized program of acupuncture in the “real world.” And that the study conclusions could be revised to suggest that acupuncture “works even when administered poorly.”  
The columnist didn’t discuss the possibility that acupuncture might actually perform worse in a real-world setting where patients don’t have to meet strict study inclusion criteria. And the article didn’t consider whether a one-point improvement on a seven-point pain scale would be considered evidence that a treatment “works”.
Overall, the article did not provide a clear view of the larger body of evidence on the risks, benefits, availability, or costs of acupuncture for any condition. And it did not adequately stress the key take-home message in this area: that sham-controlled clinical trials have not yet documented that acupuncture has a clinically important treatment effect—and that this is a gaping hole in its evidence base.  (Manheimer et al., 2007; Sherman et al., 2009).",fake,190,16,0,206

An important description of palliative care emphasizing shared decision-making.  Kudos to the NYT for framing it this way.

Our reviewers were split on one distinctive feature of this story – the discussion of the health care reform bill brought Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin into the story. One reviewer thought that had an uncertain effect and that the space could have been better used to provide more practical information about costs, benefits, and the limitations of this particular study.   The other two reviewers felt it was an appropriate and laudable editorial decision – that because the field of palliative care has been haunted by the ""death panel"" rhetoric of last summer, bringing it to the forefront in this story confronts directly one of the issues that prevent people from accessing palliative care, even when it is available — concern about palliative care hastening death.
We appreciate that the Times’s foray into this issue added some nuance that was missing in other coverage. The Times coverage also is notable for offering the most accessible description of what palliative care actually means, including practical examples of the services and treatment provided to patients. The competing coverage often relied on jargon about ""psychosocial support"" and other vague terminology that will likely be meaningless to many readers.",real,434,39,9,482

This story baldly misstates the evidence (or lack thereof) supporting the effectiveness of a device used to dissolve certain blood clots. Indeed, a careful reader would not even have to delve into the medical evidence to realize something is amiss. The story calls the Trellis Peripheral Infusion Device “life-saving,” effective, and safer and quicker than alternative therapies. However, it notes that only a handful of doctors across the country use the device (even though it has been on the market since 2005) and the clinician quoted in the story says he has used it on only eight patients, even though he sees more than 100 similar patients every year. A reader might well wonder, “If this device is so great, why do so few doctors use it and why do even those who do use it prefer to use different treatments for the overwhelming majority of their patients?” The story ignores that glaring inconsistency. 
This story is also an extreme example of disease-mongering. It portrays deep vein thrombosis as a leading killer.

The story reads like a promotion for EllaOne – exaggerating the seriousness of fibroids, failing to critically evalute the study and incompletely explaining the benefits and harms of the drug. It also minimizes the breadth of currently available options, leaving the reader with the impression that there are no good alternatives.

Fibroids are common and can cause bothersome symptoms such as pain, bleeding, and pressure in some women. However, they are also benign and deciding about how or whether to treatment them depends on how much a woman is bothered by her symptoms, feels about the pros and cons of different treatments, and whether she wishes to conserve her fertility.  There are many different safe and viable treatments available, ranging from medications to minimally invasive procedures to surgery. Women who make a fully-informed decision about treatment in conjunction with their doctor are likely to be satisfied with their treatment so long as their choice matches their goals and what’s important to them.
Even with so many options, it would be welcome news that a drug may not just treat the symptoms but actually might reduce the size of fibroids. A new study presented at this week’s European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology shows that EllaOne, currently available as an emergency contraceptive in Europe (but not in the US), may shrink fibroids and reduce symptoms relative to placebo. However, the results should be greeted cautiously. This was a small, short study and the full results have not been evaluated.

A definitive headline – ""Scientist find way to predict…"" – is far more definitive than the findings of the study reported.  The story fails to explain the many possible limitations of this approach.

Anti-Mullerian Hormone, or AMH, is a hormone produced by cells in the ovary during reproductive years and can be detected with a blood test. Declining AMH levels has been shown to correlate with poor response to in-vitro fertilization, a marker of poor ovarian reserve. This has led to the idea that the test could be used to predict the start of the menopausal transition. However, because the marker has not been studied systematically, it is unclear what different AMH levels mean. For example, what is a normal AMH level? As a result, AMH levels should be interpreted with some caution.
This story reports on results from a new study whose results are to be presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology. The study investigators developed an algorithm using AMH levels to predict onset of menopause. However, the full results of the study have not been made available and have not been evaluated by experts.
This story does little to explain to the reader the limitations of the AMH test. It presents the assertion that the test is reliable as fact and does not discuss any potential downsides. False positive results, for example, could cause unnecessary worry and anxiety and lead to needless fertility treatments. The story also does not say whether the AMH test is new or not.

Although we can guess that this was viewed as a ""business"" story, it was just a shell of the necessary information that either investors or consumers would want/need and only parroted information that came from the FDA and the drug company.

By definition, emergency contraception is meant to be used only when other means of contraception fail. Controversy about emergency contraception typically centers around how it works – whether it prevents ovulation or blocks implantation of a fertilized egg. If emergency contraception works after fertilization, some would consider it an aborting agent. Regardless of its method of action, however, emergency contraception provides a safe and effective alternative to abortion. Although many women experience uncomfortable side effects from the medication, these are temporary and there are very few risks.
In the US, the most commonly used emergency contraceptive is Plan B or levonogestrel. It contains the progestin commonly found in most birth control pills, but in much higher doses. Plan B acts to prevent ovluation. Mifeprex, or RU-486, can be used as an emergency contraceptive or aborting agent depending on when it is used. Last year, the EllaOne was approved for use in Europe and the UK. It has been shown to be effective for up to 5 days after contraceptive failure and has few side effects. Now, the FDA will meet to decide on its approval for use in the US.

The story could have been greatly improved by coming down harder on the proponents of bio-identical hormones. While the story includes a debate on whether there is evidence to support the use of bio-identical hormones, in doing so, it gives the impression that there really is a debate. Bio-identical hormone supporters claim that there have been dozens of clinical trials showing a benefit.

This story offers tantalizing hints of potential benefits of an experimental drug for melanoma, ipilimumab, but without any substance that would allow readers to judge the merits of the claims. It relies on readers to know that medical meeting presentations do not go through the sort of peer review required by leading journals. It expects readers to know what a “phase II” trial is and what sort of limitations that fact implies about the value (or lack thereof) of the study conclusions. The story fails to provide context or interpretation. Indeed, the reporter did not include any comments from anyone; the story is essentially a summary of a summary.
The story highlights a trial that is claimed to be a “first;” specifically the “first to test ipilimumab in patients whose skin cancer had spread to the brain.” How significant is that step? Other than saying that brain tumors are difficult to treat, the story doesn’t explain what is newsworthy about this trial.

This story reports on one of only 6 studies highlighted by the American Society of Clinical Oncology out of more than 4,000 abstracts posted online a month in advance of its annual meeting.  This story – while still employing some hyperbole such as “a real lifesaver” – at least had one important balancing cautious perspective.

Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125) is a protein found on the surface of certain types of ovarian cancer cells. The CA-125 test is used to monitor and guide treatment for ovarian cancer but has not been shown to be an effective screening test for average-risk women. This is because the test can come back elevated for many reasons and the false positive rate is high. However, according to new, unpublished results to be presented at next month’s American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting, monitoring change in CA-125 over time and incorporating other factors to identify higher-risk women for additional testing may identify ovarian cancers at a stage when they are treatable.
The full results have not yet been presented or published and a larger, ongoing study in the UK should provide more clarification as to whether this method should be used for widespread screening. Until then, caution should be used in interpreting these results.
This story meets all of the criteria in relatively few words. It provides an adequate description of the current study, quantifies the benefits and harms of the test and compares it to existing alternatives (of which there are none). It does not engage in disease mongering and quotes an independent expert who provides valuable insight.

This story repeats a vague promise contained in a journal news release that a CT scan could provide smokers with an earlier warning of emphysema risk. The actual research article makes no such claims of clinical usefulness. Indeed, the article and the news from the researcher’s university both emphasize that the point of this work is to offer clues to the underlying mechanism of smoking-related emphysema, to aid research into genetic variations that may be linked to lung disease risk, and to help develop new treatments by identifying and tracking subtle changes in lung blood flow.
Not only does the research itself not discuss providing smokers with warnings, it is not clear how such “warnings” would be more useful than the blanket advice to smokers that they should quit. Indeed, by suggesting the test could identify smokers who are less likely to develop emphysema, it could be that this sort of test would actually make some smoker more complacent, leaving them vulnerable to heart disease, stroke and other tobacco-related harms that are outside the scope of this “test.”

A fairly thorough review, covering costs, benefits (with a stab at absolute risk reduction), and harms.  Caveats and uncertainties were emphasized.

This week in The New England Journal of Medicine is the second of two major studies showing a reduction in prostate cancer incidence from a drug in the 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor class. The drug Avodart, commonly used to treat enlarged prostates, was shown to reduce the incidence of prostate cancer from 25% to 20% over 4 years in men with an elevated PSA but no prostate cancer on biopsy. With the results of this study, the drug maker, Glasko Smith Kline, is now seeking FDA approval for the drug for this indication. However, the results are far from a slam-dunk and the implications are controversial.
Adding to the contoversy are several factors: 1) no studies have shown a decrease in deaths from prostate cancer; 2) the side effects of the drug are significant (including a troubling finding of increased risk of heart failure); 3) lowering PSA levels is not necessarily of benefit; it just proves that the drug acts to shrink the prostate; and 4) the costs of the drug are huge – at $4 a day, it could cost up to $500,000 to prevent one case of prostate cancer (https://www.healthnewsreview.org/blog/2009/05/a-half-million.html).

A small pilot study published in this week’s Journal of the American Medical Association found that SBRT provided improvements in 3-year survival compared to what other studies have shown is achieved with conventional radiation.

Terribly misleading headline.  Story based on a news release.  No independent experts quoted to put this in perspective.

There has been recognition that RA results in gradual, cumulative destruction of joints and other parts of the body. Since we now have powerful treatment options, there has been a push to begin using them earlier. However, it’s harder to identify RA in its early stages, when diagnostic techniques such as RF testing aren’t as helpful. Therefore, there is a need for new diagnostic techniques for the identification of patients with joint problems in the early stages of RA.
That’s the context, and the social problem, described in the article. The study in question, however, is a little different. It’s about understanding the processes that lead to RA and techniques that may, in the future, lead to a test for patients who may develop RA in the future. There is no available evidence that treatment can stave off RA in patients who don’t have symptoms yet.
We would have liked to have seen the article use additional sources besides the press release. Where it does not rely on the press release, it seems to stray too far. The article claims that the investigators ""say the finding paves the way for developing a blood test for early diagnosis of the mysterious disease.""

This story clearly explains that a new review of the available evidence from published trials backs the use of Doppler ultrasound to monitor high-risk pregnancies. Notably, the story reports the absolute risk calculation of fetal or newborn deaths (1.7 percent among women who did not receive ultrasound monitoring vs. 1.2 percent among those who did), rather than trumpeting a large reduction in relative risk. By including the absolute risk numbers, the story helps readers understand both that the test appears to reduce the death rate and, importantly, that the overall risk of fetal or newborn death in developed nations is very small, thus putting the results in perspective.
This story also pointed out that there is some uncertainty about the findings because of concerns about the quality of the underlying studies including in the review. What’s more, it highlights the point that the studies included only women who had high-risk pregnancies and that there is no evidence to suggest the use of Doppler ultrasound to monitor low-risk pregnancies.

Overall good job, but didn’t discuss costs or give any evidence to support a ""cost-effective"" claim made in the story.

Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted disease and can cause cell changes that lead to cervical cancer. Each year around 12,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer in the US, however this number has declined significantly over the past 30 years due to widespread screening with pap smears. Screening for HPV can detect potential cases earlier in the progression of these cell changes. In theory, earlier detection and treatment could lead to fewer downstream cases of cervical cancer. However, very few positive HPV cases actually lead to cervical cancer so catching more HPV-positive screens means having to do additional tests and treatments on women who would never end up progressing to cancer anyway.
This story reports on the results from a large new study out of Italy published in Lancet Oncology comparing HPV DNA testing to traditional pap smears for cervical cancer screening. The study found that indeed the HPV DNA had a very high ""callback"" rate, that is the number of women testing positive and needing additional testing/treatment. In the first round of screening, similar numbers of women were found to have cancer in the two groups. However, by the second round of screening, the women in the HPV DNA group had fewer cancers than the pap smear group, presumbly because those positive for HPV had been treated earlier on in the first round. The results were statistically significant (18 cancers in the pap smear group vs 7 in the HPV DNA group).
This story does a good job of describing the current study and quotes several experts who provide valuable perspective. Most importantly, the story highlights the high false positive rate – or the high number of tests that come back positive that would never progress on to cancer. Positive results require additional testing and follow-up, which in itself isn’t particularly dangerous, but could cause anxiety and requires time off work and additional costs.
The story could have been improved by discussing the costs of the tests or mentioning the costs of the additional colposcopies that result from the higher callback rate from HPV testing.

This is a story reporting on a very recent paper with results suggesting that diffusion MRI may be used as a tool for assessing memory function and may thus someday have a role in predicting future cognitive decline including that of Alzheimer’s disease.  However the research itself did not involve individuals with Alzheimer’s disease, nor did it study individuals over time to establish whether the technique could be used to predict changes that occur for a given individual.

This story tilts strongly toward those who advocate this view and emphasizes a couple of positive anecdotes from children who benefited from an EKG. However, it provides no data demonstrating that this approach would identify more children at risk than current screening methods based on family history, personal medical history, and a thorough physical exam. Moreover, no attempt is made to balance the story with discussion of the costs and potential harms that frequent use of EKGs would entail.

Not likely, based on this point-counterpoint debate over coronary artery calcium screening.
This story demonstrates the pitfalls of presenting scientific issues as though they were political debates. This sort of “equal time” treatment gives the impression that there is equal evidence backing each side. Failing to give readers appropriate context makes the sparring claims almost impossible to judge.

Overall, a good wrapup of progress on cardiac stem cell research.

The story does a solid job of explaining that the current research, a Phase I study, can establish only that the procedure is safe, not that it is effective. The reader learns about the differences among the three phases of studies the FDA requires. The reader learns about how stem cells might benefit damaged heart muscle. 
Having said that, this story raises an existential question: Should the story have been done? 
If the results can prove only safety but not efficacy, why should a reader care? A story that demonstrates safety of a technique of no known benefit would never see mainstream publication. 
But the Phase I study results does show some promising benefits, and related research provides reason to believe the technique may indeed be useful. So should CNN report the story because of those apparent benefits, despite their not being established by data?  
That’s a lot of worry about one story. CNN decided to run with it. The report adds responsible context.

How nice to see a newspaper that still devotes more than 1,500 words to a story about research that could have an impact on many.  Overall, a strong story.

As the ratings show, for the most part the story follows best practices regarding potential harms and benefits, sourcing and context. The story veers toward the sensational with its second satisfied-patient anecdote. But taken as a whole the story provides a balanced picture of the device and its potential. 
One thing bothers us –  the story’s claim that the study data are ""widely expected to lead the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve the new version of the pump"" for chronic use–""possibly early next year.""
It’s easy to get caught up in the enthusiasm of a device maker, excited physicians, ""breakthrough"" treatments and patients happy to be alive. 
But it should never lead to prediction of approval. Any student of the FDA–or pharmaceutical stock prices–knows the agency’s decisions are uNPRedictable.

story_reviews_01692,"Radiation From CT Scans May Raise Cancer Risk

Well done story on an important topic.  Important discussion about the wide range of doses of radiation exposure among different hospitals.

Computed Tomography (CT) scans produce incredibly detailed high-resolution pictures of the body, making them invaluable tools for the detection and treatment of disease. However as doctors rely on them more and more for diagnosis and monitoring and patients demand them for every ache and pain, the utilization of these high-tech scans has increased dramatically over the past 20 years. But how much imaging is too much? What if the burden of radiation exposure from these scans outweighs the benefits? Two new studies published in the Archives of Internal Medicine this week raise the concern that all of this scanning may be too much of a good thing. One study predicts that between 15,000 and 45,000 future cases of cancer may be caused by the radiation exposure, while another study tracks huge variation in the amount of radiation patients are exposed to, even for the same type of scan.
Overall, this story was well done.  By accurately describing the predicted number of cases of cancer and resulting dealths in the study, the story avoids disease mongering. The story mentions several other testing options, such as simpler CT tests, conventional X-rays, ultrasound or MRI that involve less or no radiation. The story does a good job of describing the harm of exposure to radiation due to CT scanning, but could have also mentioned other harms from overuse of scanning, such as follow-up testing and procedures to evaluate suspicious findings that turn out to be benign. 
The story could have been improved by describing the costs of CT scanning, which are substantial and climbing. We also think the story should have commented on the nature of the study projecting the number of deaths due to radiation from CT scans.  The study used a model to predict cases of cancer and subsequent deaths. These cases were projected, but not directly observed. Modeling studies, while useful, have certain limitations and their results should be interpreted with caution. The story does not describe these limitations, other than to cite skepticism from a radiologist.",real,105,11,0,116

story_reviews_01694,"Radiation from CT scans may raise cancer risks

The story was well done.  Shortcomings: no independent expert perspectives, no discussion of the possible limitations of such a risk modeling study and no discussion of the study that showed a wide range of doses of radiation exposure among different hospitals – an important issue.

There is no doubt that advances in imaging technology have revolutionized how we diagnose and treat disease. The past two decades have seen dramatic increases in the utilization of high tech imaging tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). The ever expanding list of indications and uses for these technologies have been a boon for device manufacturers, hospitals and radiologists, however is there a potential for overuse? At what point may the harms of these tests outweigh the benefits? Two new studies published in The Archives of Internal Medicine highlight rather starkly the particular harm of radiation exposure from CT scanning. In one study, the authors predict that between 15,000 and 45,000 future cancers could be caused by ionizing radiation from CT scans.
This story clearly describes the harm of radiation exposure from CT scanning. It could have also mentioned that excessive CT scanning can also lead to unecessary follow-up testing and/or procedures for suspicious findings that turn out to be benign.
The story could have been improved by elaborating on the strength of the evidence to support the findings of the number of deaths attributable to CT scans. The numbers cited in the story come from a risk model that estimates the expected number of deaths based on the amount of radiation exposure in a particular year. These deaths were not directly observed, but were rather predicted. This approach, while valid, has its own limitations and set of caveats that should be mentioned. It could have also discussed costs of CT scanning, which are substantial and increasing.
The story does not quote sources other than the authors of the study. The story should have quoted independent experts who could have provided perspective on the importance of these results.
Finally  the story missed some wonderful opportunities to educate consumers on the problem of radiation exposure. The second article in the journal highlights the dramatic differences in radiation exposure in routine clinical CT scans in four academic hospitals.  The radiation differences noted were significant with up to a 22 fold difference in exposures seen in the same scans.  Radiation exposure from CT scans appears to represent a public health problem, which is particularly important in young and middle aged women.  No attempts were made to point out that in many instances other diagnostic methods are available, including MRI, ultrasound and routine xrays that involve less or no radiation.",fake,105,11,0,116

story_reviews_01697,"Diagnosing Breast Cancer: Needle Biopsy Best?

The story seemed to lock in on the impressive-sounding figure of 80 studies that were included in the systematic review.  But the quality of those studies was never discussed.  No data given comparing false positives or false negatives. No explanation of complications or side effects.

This is a newly published systematic review of varying quality studies that were previously published — however, there is no new information  here – something the story could have made clear. At leading breast centers the ‘best practice’ is to get a breast cancer diagnosis without open surgery, and usually via a core needle biopsy (CNB),  but that practice has not been adopted everywhere, sometimes because of the machines (image guided bioppsy) that are needed to complete these types of biopsies are not available, or because breast surgeons are involved in care so they just remove a suspicious mass with a surgical biopsy. 
Women should know that there are different types of breast biopsies following an abnormal mammogram.  Core needle biospy  (CNB) is less invasive and leaves less scaring that a surgical biopsy.  There is also less chance of post-surgical infection with core needle v. surgical biopsy.  The story here alludes to fewer complication with CNB v. surgery, dind’t explain what the side effects are. 
Both methods appear to be accurate for detecting cancerous v. non-cancerous breast cells.  The majority of women who are referred for breast biopsy do not have malignant lesions and do not require follow-up treatment, so the fewer surgical procedures a woman undergoes following an abnormal mammogram, the better.  CNB may allow many women  who are diagnosed with breast cancer to reduce the number of surgical procedures that they must undergo during treatment.",fake,55,1,0,56

There were some clear attempts at balance, but the story didn’t provide any independent perspective, any discussion of costs or potential harms, or any emphasis on the fact that there are no hard data on outcomes.

The journalistic challenge with a story like this is to balance hype and hope. This review takes in both the broadcast segment that appeared on CNN and the similar but longer print version that appears on the CNN web site.
First, by choosing a study subject who has had promising but unspectacular results, the story provides a more realistic view of outcomes than would a piece wrapped around a subject, like one referred to in the story, who is said to be able to shoot baskets.
Second, the story supplements positive comments with those tempered by realism. Eight paragraphs are devoted to purely positive comments. Four tamp down expectations with more realistic statements about the limits of current outcomes and future benefits. Five paragraphs are internally balanced with positive and tempered views. 
The tempered comments come lower in the story, however, and follow an opening anecdote brimming with emotion and hope. The story ends in a similar fashion. Taking all things into account, the story tilts too positive. 
What could have balanced the scales? 
A quote from a truly disinterested source. All three sources in the story are involved with the research: a physician treating the patient, a source from an advocacy group involved with the research, and a spokeman for Second Sight Inc., the company that makes the device.
The perspective of an ophthalmologist who treats patients with retinitis pigmentosa, yet has no involvement with development of an artificial retina, could have added balance. 
And finally, the story fails to put this device in context of other artificial retina development efforts and other technologies intended to improve or restore sight. The result is a false sense that we are learning of a dramatic breakthrough of one device. Not true. Many other devices and treatments are in development, enough so that a government agency is supporting them all. The viewers should have been told that.",fake,139,14,0,153
